 What I DoI’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI to make it faster, safer, and more human-centered. From optimizing LLMs to uncovering biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, I’m driven by the idea that AI can solve real-world problems while staying ethical and secure.Currently, I’m diving deep into:AI Safety: Building robust evaluation frameworks for LLMs.
Optimization: Squeezing every bit of efficiency from inference pipelines.
Biomedical AI: Decoding complex datasets to advance healthcare.
Privacy: Pioneering secure, privacy-preserving ML models.

 Research & ImpactHarvard UniversityResearch Intern under Prof. Devashree Tripathy | Sep 2024 - Dec 2024  Slashed LLM inference time by 20% using VIDUR optimizations.  
Boosted tool usage by 15% with Meta-Llama integrations.  
Generated 10K+ synthetic samples to stress-test model diversity.

MIT Camera Culture GroupML Intern, MIT Media Lab | Jan 2025 - Mar 2025  Developed privacy-preserving ML model obfuscation techniques.  
Evaluated security with adversarial attack models.  
Contributed to benchmark datasets and testing frameworks.

National Institutes of HealthResearch Intern under Dr. Chris Grunseich | Aug 2024 - Present  Achieved 90% serum, 99% plasma classification accuracy in biomarker studies.  
Analyzed 100+ gene-expression datasets for neurodegenerative research.  
Reduced processing time by 30% through pipeline optimizations.

 Projects & Publications AAAI 2025: Novel Vision Architecture

 A Bit About MeWhen I’m not debugging code or tweaking models, you’ll find me sipping coffee at a Mumbai café, lost in a sci-fi novel, or chasing sunsets by the Arabian Sea. I believe AI should amplify human potential, not replace it, and I’m excited to build systems that make a difference—one line of code at a time.Fun facts:Favorite Algorithm: Gradient Descent (because life’s all about iterative improvement).  
Go-To Stack: Python, PyTorch, and a dash of creativity.  
Dream Project: Building an AI to predict Mumbai’s monsoon traffic chaos!
